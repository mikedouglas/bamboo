# colophon

This site is hand-built, combining some awesome pieces of software,
including [ruby], [sinatra], and [pandoc] into a package called
[bamboo]. Unlike [most web publishing tools][wordpress], bamboo doesn't
require a database, provides a minimal security vector, and lets you
manage your writing as markdown files in git. Unlike [most
markdown-powered static site generators][jekyll], bamboo avoids a
separate build step by being dynamically generated, and instead, taking
full advantage of HTTP caching.

That said, it's built solely around my needs, making it a poor choice if
I haven't run up against your use case yet. If you know ruby, and feel
adventurous, the [source][bamboo] is up on github.

If you're using a modern browser (and you should be), the text you're
reading is displayed in a mixture of Futura PT and Adobe Minion Pro,
thanks to the talented folks at [typekit].

Everything is hosted in a tiny VPS with [prgmr].
