# Hi.

My name is Mike Douglas. I'm a student at the University of British
Columbia, and a prospective software engineer. This is my little corner
of the web.

# Elsewhere

I put my stuff on the web and let other people back it up.

* [github] -- code, dotfiles, &tc.
* [last.fm] -- what I'm listening to when I'm staring at a screen.
* [pinboard] -- bookmarks.
* [twitter] -- status updates and attempts at wit.

# Contact

If you're stuck in the 20th century, you can always reach me at
[hello@entropy.io](mailto:hello@entropy.io) and I'll try to help you fix
your time machine.
